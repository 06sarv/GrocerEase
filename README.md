GrocerEase

GrocerEase is a 3-tier application designed to simplify grocery management and enhance customer convenience. It consists of three main layers: the frontend, backend, and database. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, providing a clean and responsive user interface that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

The backend is powered by Python and the Flask framework. It handles business logic, API interactions, and user authentication, ensuring smooth operation and secure data management. For storing data, MySQL serves as the reliable database layer, managing product inventory, customer information, and order details efficiently.

GrocerEase helps grocery stores track inventory, process orders, and gain valuable insights through its user-friendly interface. The application ensures that store managers and customers have a seamless experience, whether they are checking stock levels, managing orders, or viewing sales reports.
